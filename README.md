# thresholds

#### a digital model of David Dunn's "Thresholds and Fragile States" 

---

This will be a work-in-progress over the next few months:

### Done:
* chaotic oscillator UGen w/ basic examples (see .schelp)
* sclang psedu-UGens for network nodes (amp, pre-amp, vactrol, filters, LFO, etc)
* harcoded 8-osc version of the piece as David usually configues it (initial draft)
* basic GUI

### Doing:
* modular "patching" version for variable number of oscillators and network topology
* lots more GUI stuff
* pictures + circuit diagrams for explanation / documentation
* extras/measurment code for measuring the analog components
* extras/LTSpice simulations
